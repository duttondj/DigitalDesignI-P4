# Project 4: Design and Synthesis of a Synchronous Finite State Machine

The objective of this project is to design a group of interacting finite state machines
that mimic the operation of a vending machine. The vending machine can accept change,
dispense a product, and return change. Additionally, it can be put into maintenance mode where
it can be preloaded with quarters, dimes, and nickels to be used as change for future purchases.
